This is a project to help you (and especially me) to start a HTML5 project very quickly. I took the best elements of:
 * Initializr: http://initializr.com/ - based on HTML5 Boilerplate
 * Less Framework 4: http://lessframework.com/
 
 And converted it to Sass: http://sass-lang.com/ (SCSS format). I also trying to create some handy mixins to create Less columns more easily.
 
 Name is based on the three frameworks i'm using. initLessSass. Have fun!
